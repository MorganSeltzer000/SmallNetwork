# SmallNetwork
This is a NetWork Simulation Project implemented in Go. In this project, we will establish TCP connection with simulated random delay among many devices connected 
by using a configuration file.

There are 2 major parts of the file:
- config.txt: The configuration file contains 9 lines: the first line is the minimum and maximum simulated delay. The other lines contain three information: ID, IP Address, and Port Number. 
- main.go: This is the main executable file that contains all code. It contains the following functions.
